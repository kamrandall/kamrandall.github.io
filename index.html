                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p class="about_me_text">I used to be a Vascular surgeon. Well, technically I quit right after graduating from my residency. I do still have a license to practice medicine though. But then I thought real hard and long about what I <em>actually</em> like and I ended up learning Web levelopment. </p>
                <p class="about_me_text">Working as an MD has given me many transferable soft skills. I don't crumble under pressure, I learn fast and I work hard at anything I do. I have excellent teamwork and communication skills (doctors are nothing without nurses and other medical staff). And because being a resident means changing departments and hospitals every few months - I adapt well to a new enviroment and quickly gain new skills.</p>
                <p class="about_me_text">Apart from work I love rollerskating, cycling, hiking with my dog Grikis and reading murder mysteries (currently trying to solve Cain's jawbone)</p>
